## New Commands

Because the main use-case of rabbit2 is for use privately within an organisation, this repo  isn't intended to become a reference of all possible commands out there. That being said, if you've created a command that you feel others could benefit from, feel free to submit a pull request with your added command and we'll go from there. Your command entry should:

- Have a descriptive... `description`.
- Include `usage` instructions.
- Not conflict with existing command names.
- Not contain any identifiable URLs (use `process.env.VARIABLE`).
